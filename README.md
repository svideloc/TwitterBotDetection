# TwitterBotDetection

## Project Goals/Overview

The purpose of this project was to use labeled spambot or real user data for twitter users to identify if a user was real or a bot. In order to access data for this project labeled data was used from The Bot Repository (https://botometer.iuni.iu.edu/bot-repository/index.html). Using the user_id's the twitter API was then used to gather user and twitter data.
